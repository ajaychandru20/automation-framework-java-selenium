# Automation Testing Masterclass with Java, Selenium & BDD

This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive course on automation testing. The course is designed to take you from the fundamental concepts of Java and Object-Oriented Programming to building a robust, scalable automation framework from scratch.

## 📚 About the Course

This masterclass covers everything you need to know to become a proficient automation engineer. It is structured to provide a solid theoretical foundation followed by practical application, ensuring you not only learn the tools but also understand the best practices for building maintainable and efficient test automation solutions.

### 🔑 Key Concepts Covered

  * **Java Fundamentals:** A deep dive into core Java and OOP principles, essential for writing clean and scalable automation code.
  * **Selenium WebDriver:** Learn how to interact with web applications, handle dynamic elements, and perform various testing actions.
  * **Design Patterns:** Understand and implement design patterns to manage complex, repeatable situations and build a modular automation framework.
  * **Unit Testing Frameworks:** Master popular unit testing libraries like **JUnit** and **TestNG** for structuring and executing your tests.
  * **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Utilize **Cucumber** to create human-readable test scenarios that bridge the gap between technical and non-technical team members.
  * **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate your tests into **CI/CD pipelines** (e.g., using GitLab) to automate test execution and ensure continuous quality.
  * **Full Stack SDET:** Gain the knowledge and skills required to thrive as a Software Development Engineer in Test.
